# AngularJS todo exercise

## About
The exercise shows how to create todo list on AngularJS v.1.5.5

- You can use `cmd+b/ctrl+b` and `cmd+i/ctrl+i` hotkeys to make text **bold** or *italic* accordingly.
- The todo list shows data as JSON in **real-time**.
- You can re-order the list's elements, using drag and drop.

I have tested the code only in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

## Libraries
I use [ngDraggable](https://github.com/fatlinesofcode/ngDraggable) library for a drag-and-drop behaviour,
because it works without HTML5 drag and drop API. And you can create draggable elements with any design.

And I made some changes in the library, which help me easier to use my todo list.
